**Welcome to my project repository!**

Inspired by this [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/8qsQq0HqbeNcG3QvN46rNx/website-landing-page-design-(Community)-(Copy)?node-id=515%3A1120&mode=dev), I've brought it to life using HTML, CSS and React.

I focused on details, honed Figma-to-code skills, improved CSS positioning, followed Atomic Design for modularity, and used SCSS for efficient styling.
